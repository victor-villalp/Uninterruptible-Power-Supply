# Uninterruptible-Power-Supply
TI Tiva C Launchpad configuration for an uninterruptible power supply that inverts 12V DC power from a battery to 110V/60Hz AC power and an accompanying Java graphical user interface (GUI) that plots and graphs serially transmitted temperature and voltage readings using UART protocol and the jSerialComm library.                                                                                                                                    
Project features:
- Real Time Temperature Protection
- Real Time Overload Protection
